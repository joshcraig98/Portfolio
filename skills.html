				<h1>Skills</h1>
					<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
						<p>I have been in IT for nearly five years and troubleshooting has been one of the things constantly drilled into my brain. I've learned to follow different processes and models, such as the OSI and TCP/IP models, to troubleshoot efficiently and effectively.</p>
					<h4>Time Management</h4>
						<p>Between work, school, and home, I am always busy. One thing I learned quickly is that you need to keep a balance. I have achieved this through creating schedules to divide my time up so I can accomplish what I need to and still have time to relax and learn new skills.</p>
					<h4>Adaptability</h4>
						<p>One thing I learned though is that life doesn't always want to follow your plans and schedules. Between coworkers getting sick, projects breaking, and other unexpected emergencies, I've learned how to adapt and overcome the road blocks. I do this by staying persistent, focusing on what is most important, and taking it one step at a time until all fires are put out.</p>
					<h4>Leadership</h4>
						<p>I have had some experience in leadership positions such as my time as vice president and co-founder of a club in college, being the leader of a couple group projects in school, and my time working in project management. They have each been humbling experiences that have taught me the importance of listening and gathering input from all team members and how to make hard decisions as well as other skills like teamwork and communication.</p>
					<h4>Teamwork and Communication</h4>
						<p>Two things have been consistent in making or breaking any project or group work I've participated in and they are teamwork and communication. Without proper communication, teamwork suffers. When teamwork suffers, productivity goes way down. I've learned that treating your coworkers with respect and properly communicating your issues without pinning blame can go a long way in making sure projects go smoothly.</p>
